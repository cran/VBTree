Description: Provides a new data structure, vector binary tree, to make
  your data visiting and management more efficient. if your data has
  very structurized column names with specific connecting pattern, it can 
  read, split, and factorize these names, then build the mapping from all
  string objects to an array or tensor, through vector binary tree, by
  which the batched data processing can be implemented easily. The methods
  of array and tensor are also applicable.
